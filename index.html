    <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
    <p>This is my first site so do not expect much.</p>

    <h2>What is c++?</h2>
    <p>C++ is a compiled programming language that needs a compiler to be compiled.</p>
    <p>C++ is also a oop(object oriented programming) language, meaning that you can make classes and 3d engines and stuff associated with it. <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59276?s=280&v=4" style="position: absolute; filter: grayscale(100%); height: 200px; margin-left: 100px;"></p>
    <p>C++ is also used for system automation, and also does mabye almost all the calculations you see in modern games under the hood.</p>
    <p>But c++ is also used for <b>malicious</b> stuff. Lets not get into the dark side of c++ but i can say history of c++ viruses</p>
    <p>C++ can do system level stuff as you know, such as changing wallpapers, messing with api and alot more.</p>
    <p>Most cyber security systems today use c++ for automation(i think).</p>
    <p>Anyways most viruses today use c or c++ for <b>malicious</b> stuff such as malware, trojans, worms and more.</p>
    <p>C++ is also considered c but more organized.</p>
    <h3>Why use c++?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It is <b>VERY</b> fast due to it being a compiled language.</li>
        <li>It does a good job at calculating, helping 3d engine work and render and much more!</li>
        <li>The language is hard but worth it because it gives you more control.</li>
        <li>In my opinion it is superior to c because it has more stuff and is more organized.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now lets do less facts and more coding onto the next section!</p>

    <h2>Basic c++</h2>
    <p>Let's print in c++!</p>
    <p>First make sure to include <b>iostream</b> when printing otherwise you will not get to print stuff! Like this:</p>
    <pre><code>
    &#35include &lt;iostream&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>After that start a <b>main function</b> this powers the whole c++ program!</p>
    <pre><code>
    &#35include &lt;iostream&gt;
    int main() {
    }
    </code></pre>
    <p>After that you need to write something in the <b>output</b> to make it print!</p>
    <pre><code>
    &#35include &lt;iostream&gt;
    int main() {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello";
    }
    </code></pre>
    <p>I will explain this carefully so you understand.</p>
    <p><b>std</b> is standard like the standard way to use libraries.</p>
    <p><b>::</b> is like the scope to use the libraries.</p>
    <p><b>Cout</b> is the output.</p>
    <p><b>&lt;&lt;</b> is like saying write or input something here!</p>
    <p><b>""</b> is a string aka a string of letters</p>
    <p>And finally <b>;</b> is for ending a line.</p>
    <p>Oh yeah i forgot add <b>return 0;</b> to say like "Hey this function passed! It was a sucsess". So now type:</p>
    <pre><code>
    &#35include &lt;iostream&gt;
    int main() {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello";
        return 0;
    }
    </code></pre>
